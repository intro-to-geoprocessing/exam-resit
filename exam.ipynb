    "In this notebook you will complete the final exam for Introduction to Geoprocessing. The notebook is in the format you are used to from the past months of class and course material. You can open it in the online browser-based Jupyterhub environment or choose to download the entire folder and complete the exam in the editor of your choice (e.g. VS Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam consists of two parts. First, you will be asked a series of more theoretical questions about the course's learning objectives. You will have to answer these questions by writing your response in a Markdown cell. The second part of the exam is of a more practical nature, in which you will be asked to complete a few small tasks by writing or correcting some Python code. The number of points you can score for each question (total points = 20) is indicated as well. **Although information from the course material and elsewhere may be helpful in the exam, it is is crucial you answer each question IN YOUR OWN WORDS and WITH YOUR OWN CODE.** You may use the course material, your notes and other information online as your reference but any form of communication with classmates or otherwise (e.g. e-mail, message, slack) is absolutely not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the exam, you will have to convert your notebook to HTML and submit both the `.html` and the `.ipynb` version on the exam submission page in xToledo. Make sure to check both files to ensure they are complete and correct (i.e. all code, figures and Markdown cells are complete and correctly rendered) as you only have one chance to submit these files. You can create as many code and Markdown cells as you deem necessary for answering the question/task."

For these two data types include at least the following characteristics: the kind of data that can be stored, how elements within the data can be accessed, and when to use certain data types. Try to structure your answer and indicate differences or similarities between the different types. You can use very short code blocks to illustrate."
